      <li>⅔ cup whole-wheat flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>⅔ cup old-fashioned rolled oats plus 1 tablespoon, divided</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups mashed ripe banana</li>
      <li>½ cup packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup plain whole-milk yogurt</li>
      <li>¼ cup canola oil or other neutral oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
      <li>⅓ cup dark chocolate chips (60-70%) plus 1 tablespoon, divided</li>

      </ul>

<p><h1>Directions</h1></p>
<P><h3>Step 1</h3></P>
<p>Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly coat a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray; line with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on the long sides of the pan.</p>

<p><h3>Step 2</h3></p>
<p>Whisk all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, salt and 2/3 cup oats together in a medium bowl.</p>

<P><h3>Step 3</h3></P>
<p>Combine banana, brown sugar, yogurt, oil, vanilla and egg in a large bowl; stir until well mixed.</p>

<P><h3>Step 4</h3></P>
<p>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients; stir until just combined. Stir in 1/3 cup chocolate chips.</p>

<P><h3>Step 5</h3></P>
<p>Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon each chocolate chips and oats. Bake until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool completely in the pan on a wire rack, about 35 minutes. Using the parchment overhang, remove the bread from the pan.</p>

<p><h1>To make ahead</h1></p>
<p>Wrap tightly in plastic wrap or foil and store at room temperature for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 3 months.</p>
