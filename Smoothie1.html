    <h1>Anti-Inflammatory Beet Smoothie</h1>
    <p>This vibrant beet smoothie combines sweet and earthy beets with berries, banana and orange juice for a well-balanced flavor. Look for packaged cooked beets where the prepared fruits and vegetables are sold. <a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291122/surprising-health-benefits-of-beets/">Beets are high in belatins</a>, an antioxidant that may help decrease inflammation in the body. Other nutrient-packed ingredients add even more anti-inflammatory power, like the anthocyanins in blueberries and the gingerol found in ginger.</p>
