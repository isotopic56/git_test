<p><h1>Nutrition Notes</h1>
<p><h2>Can I Eat Eggs If I Have High Cholesterol?</h2></p>
<p>While it's true that eggs are high in cholesterol, most studies show that regularly eating eggs has a minimal impact on increasing cholesterol levels. The American Heart Association is leaning more toward excessive saturated fat intake as being a bigger cholesterol-raising culprit. Eggs are also full of nutrients, including protein, choline and vitamins D and B12.</p>

<p><h2>Is Celery Good for You?</h2></p>
<p>Celery is 95% water, which means that it's a hydrating food. It's also a good source of vitamin K and antioxidants. According to the USDA, one cup of chopped celery will give you about 6% of your daily fiber needs.</p>

<P><h1>Tips from the Test Kitchen</h1></P>
<p><h2>What Are Celery Hearts? Can I Use Celery Stalks Instead?</h2></p>
<p>Celery hearts are the inner ribs of celery and are light green in color with a mild flavor. They are more tender than outer celery stalks and have fewer tough strings. When buying a bunch of celery, use the inner stalks for this recipe. You can also purchase celery hearts separately at most grocery stores. If you prefer to use outer celery stalks, remove the tough fibrous strings with a knife or vegetable peeler before chopping.</p>

<p><h2>I Don't Have Champagne Vinegar. Is There a Substitute?</h2></p>
<p>Champagne vinegar is a type of vinegar made from the same grapes used to make Champagne, typically chardonnay and pinot noir. It has a crisp and mild acidic flavor. If you don't have champagne vinegar, you can use white-wine vinegar or rice vinegar as a substitute.</p>

<p><h2>How to Serve Egg Salad</h2></p>
<p>Serve this egg salad on top of a bed of greens, sandwich it between slices of whole-wheat bread or pair it with carrot and celery sticks. Pack it into bento-style lunchboxes with crackers, veggies and fresh fruit for healthy lunches during the week.</p>
